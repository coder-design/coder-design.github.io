        <h1>HAPPY FATHER'S DAY!</h1>
        <h2 class= "title" >Dear Dad,</h2>
        <p>You do so much for me and Dana and I love you so much for everything  you do! I love watching the Celtics with you and going on trips to the dump. I also love (and find it a little funny) when we watch a movie and you would rather watch a chick flick with me instead of an action/horror movie. Although we fight and get on each other's nerves sometimes (especially because of COVID), I love you so much and I really do not know what I would do without you. I cannot wait for the celtics to come back on television and for us to yell at the tv when something does not go out (the celtics) way.</p>
        <h3 class = "title"> Why I am thankful for you!</h3>
        <ul id = "thankful">        
            <li> You Working to give me and Dana a good life</li>
            <li> You do the dishes after mom cooks an amazing meal, no matter how messy the clean up is</li>
            <li> For helping me with ALL of the Bullshit I put you through *insert laughing emoji* </li>
            <li> AND for so so much more!</li>
            <li>You have helped me to accomplish so much in the past 17 years
        </ul>
        <h3 class = "title"> Next, some of the reasons why I love you!</h3>
        <ul id = "love">
            <li>You are my dad, so I kinda have to love you, JK </li>
            <li> You get me everything I need (and most things I want) </li>
            <li> You are so strong and hardworking! </li>
            <li>I get to act like a tomboy one second by watching Celtics games with you, working out aggressively, etc. and acting like a girlie girl with my outfits and the things I say the next</li>
            <li>You are always so proud of me, even for my little accomplishments
            <li> And lastly I JUST LOVE YOU!!</li>
