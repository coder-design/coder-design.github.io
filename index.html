        <p>Hi! I am Jessica, but you can call me Jess, Jessie, or you can call me Jessica (I do not care!). I was born in 2003. I love to <strong>code</strong> and I would love to learn how to <strong>sign</strong> and mabe even how to <strong>speak Hebrew</strong> one day! I also love to <strong>workout</strong>, <em>especially</em> at CrossFit, and I love to throw <strong>Shot-Put</strong> for my high school Track&Field team. I love scifi and action tv shows and movies. Marvel movies are my favorite type of movies, and <strong>Robert Downey Jr.</strong>, otherwise known as Iron Man, is my favorite superheo! Lastly, I am Jewish, and one of my <em>happiest</em> places is when I am at a <strong>NFTY event</strong>, which is a Jewish oranization!</p>

        <h3>Day 1 of Quarantine</h3>
        <h5>March 15th, 2020</h5>
        <p>I decided to sleep most of the day because I was not allowed to leave the house. Once I <em>finally</em> woke up, I ate some breakfast and I decided to do a <strong>workout</strong>. After I worked out I watched telivison all day. It was pretty boring but I did not want to do anywork if I did not have to. In additon for me being stuck at home, my sister was not home from college yet because she goes to college in North Carolina and has not been able to get a ticket home yet.</p>

        <h3> Day 19 0f Quarantine</h3>
        <h5>April 4th, 2020</h5>
        <p>Today I woke up around 10am, and I walked my dog around our block. It was funny, because I <em>barely</em> saw anyone on my walk. After I got home I fed my dog, and I made myself something for breakfast. I then decided that I <em>should</em> work on some <strong>homework</strong>. Later that day, I did some <strong>coding</strong>, and it was really fun! I had a brussel sprout salad for lunch that was <em>amazing</em>. Lastly, I decided to do a <strong>workout</strong>. As you can see by the title, it is now day 19 of Quarantine and I am getting incredibly bored on doing <strong>nothing</strong> all day, so I am trying to be more prodictive <em>everyday</em>!</p>
